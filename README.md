## Material Design Theme Configurator Desktop Application ##

### About ###
I was always curious about how each Material Theme color applies across all of the Material Components.
This application allows you to configure your Theme colors and toggle the Out of the Box optional elements
on each Material Component.
Once you have the Theme they way you like you can export that theme to your @Compose code
